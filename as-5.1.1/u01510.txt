Version 5.10 Update 1
2015_06_27

   This  update  for  Version  5.10  of the  ASxxxx Cross
Assemblers includes fixes for the following errors:

   (1)  The as6500 assembler incorrectly assembled
        cpx # and cpy # instructions.

   (2)  An error in asmain.c inhibited the listing of
        all .if.. assembler directives.

   Merge the update asxv5pxx directory and subdirectories
with the V5.10 distribution.  The following files will be
overwritten:

[asxv5pxx\as6500]
      m65mch.c
      t6500.asm

[asxv5pxx\asxxsrc]
      asmain.c
      asxxxx.h

[asxv5pxx\linksrc]
      aslink.h

[asxv5pxx\asxhtml]
      aschng.htm

[asxv5pxx]
      u01510.txt


   You must recompile the ASxxxx Assemblers and Linker
to incorporate the update.
